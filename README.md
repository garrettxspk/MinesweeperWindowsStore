MinesweeperWindowsStore
=======================
This program behaves like a typical minesweeper game does. 
A board of varying difficulty can be selected, or a board of 
custom size and number of mines. The player then tries to reveal
or "dig up" all squares that aren't mines. Squares that aren't mines
have a number denoting the number of mines that can be found in the 
8 immediately neighbouring squares. A player can place a flag on 
a square that they are sure is a mine, or they can place a "?" on 
a square where there MIGHT be a mine. Both a flag and a "?" cannot be 
"dug up" until removed. The game implements sound effects and keeps 
track of the time spent playing.


No known bugs exist.

Most coding was done in paired programming, 
however the division of work that was not is as follows:

Garrett - 
	Save board state 
	Sound effects
	End game when all mines marked
	
Sam -
	Visual layout of mine counter and timer
	High scores
	
Final division of work load

Garrett - 55%
Sam - 45%
